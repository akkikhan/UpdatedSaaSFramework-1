# Email Authentication Issue - Immediate Solution Needed

## Current Status
- ✅ Credentials are correctly loaded: dev-saas@primussoft.com / First@098
- ✅ SMTP configuration is proper: smtp.office365.com:587
- ❌ Office 365 is rejecting authentication (Error 535)

## Most Likely Cause
Microsoft Office 365 has recently tightened security policies. Even if this worked before, accounts can suddenly require App Passwords when:

1. **Microsoft detects new login patterns**
2. **Security defaults are automatically enabled**
3. **Account is flagged for unusual activity**

## Immediate Solutions (Pick One)

### Option 1: Generate Office 365 App Password (Recommended)
1. Go to https://portal.office.com
2. Sign in with dev-saas@primussoft.com
3. Profile → My Account → Security → Additional security verification
4. Generate app password for "Mail"
5. Update SMTP_PASSWORD secret with the new 16-character app password

### Option 2: Use Gmail (Quick Alternative)
If you have a Gmail account:
1. Enable 2FA on Gmail
2. Generate app password for Gmail
3. Update secrets:
   - SMTP_USERNAME: your-gmail@gmail.com
   - SMTP_PASSWORD: your-gmail-app-password

### Option 3: Check Office 365 Admin Settings
1. Go to Microsoft 365 admin center
2. Check if "SMTP AUTH" is enabled for the account
3. Ensure "Modern Authentication" is enabled

## Testing Process
After updating credentials:
1. Restart the application
2. Test: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health`
3. Should show: `"email": true`

## Current Impact
- ✅ Platform is fully functional
- ✅ Tenant onboarding wizard works
- ❌ Email notifications won't send
- ❌ Welcome emails won't be delivered

## Timeline
This should be resolved within 5-10 minutes once you have access to the email account settings.
