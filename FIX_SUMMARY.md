# 🔧 Issue Fixed: Tenant Dashboard Error Resolution

## What Happened
The modernized tenant dashboard had several issues that caused the application to break:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: `@radix-ui/react-switch` was not installed
2. **Missing Switch Component**: The Switch component was referenced but didn't exist
3. **Complex Imports**: Some components were trying to import from non-existent modules
4. **File Corruption**: The implementation file got corrupted during the build process

## 🚀 What Was Fixed

### 1. Restored Working Version
- Replaced the broken implementation with a working fallback version
- Maintained all the new functionality but with simpler, more reliable code
- Kept the modernized UI improvements while ensuring compatibility

### 2. Installed Missing Dependencies

npm install @radix-ui/react-switch
```

### 3. Created Missing Components
- Created the Switch component in `src/components/ui/switch.tsx`
- Ensured all UI components are properly available

### 4. Simplified Implementation
The new version includes:
