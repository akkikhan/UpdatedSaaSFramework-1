# Claims Demo Presentation Flow

This guide outlines a suggested flow when presenting the Claims Management demo to senior management.

1. **Login Experience**
   - Start at the Claims portal login page and show Azure AD sign-in.
   - Mention alternative SSO options like Auth0 and SAML enabled in the platform.
2. **Dashboard Overview**
   - After login, highlight the dashboard stats and recent activity charts.
3. **Role-Based Access**
   - Demonstrate how actions differ for Viewer, Adjuster and Approver roles.
   - Switch a user's role in the Tenant Portal and refresh the Claims app to show instant permission updates.
4. **Logging Visibility**
   - Open the Logs page to show events captured for the current tenant automatically.
5. **Extensibility**
   - Conclude by emphasizing modular architecture and how additional modules (notifications, AI Copilot) can plug in the same way.

This sequence showcases a realistic enterprise application built with the SaaS framework without relying on mocked data or UIs.
