## SaaS Framework Use Cases

This platform provides a multi-tenant foundation that can be adapted to a
variety of real‑world scenarios. Some example applications include:

1. **B2B Software Services** – Deliver hosted applications such as CRM,
   project management, or invoicing where each customer organization operates
   in an isolated tenant space.

2. **Regulated Industries** – Offer compliance tooling for sectors like
   healthcare or finance where strict data separation and audit logging are
   required.

3. **Developer Platforms** – Expose APIs and SDKs that allow third‑party
   developers to build modules or integrate with the tenant data while the
   framework manages authentication, RBAC, and email services.

4. **Internal Enterprise Tools** – Host centralized administrative portals for
   large organizations that manage multiple subsidiaries or departments under
   one deployment.

5. **White‑Label Solutions** – Spin up branded tenant portals quickly for
   resellers or partners while maintaining a single code base and operational
   infrastructure.

These use cases illustrate how the framework can accelerate development of
multi‑tenant SaaS offerings across diverse industries.
