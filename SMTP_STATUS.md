# SMTP Configuration Status

## Current Issue: Authentication Failure (Error 535)

The email service is configured but failing to authenticate with Office 365 SMTP.

### Current Configuration
- **SMTP Host**: smtp.office365.com  
- **SMTP Port**: 587
- **Username**: dev-saas@primussoft.com
- **Password Length**: 8 characters ("First@098")
- **Security**: STARTTLS with TLS 1.2

### Problem Analysis
The error "535 5.7.139 Authentication unsuccessful" indicates that Office 365 is rejecting the current password. This typically happens when:

1. **2-Factor Authentication is enabled** on the Office 365 account
2. **App Passwords are required** for SMTP access
3. **The regular account password doesn't work** for SMTP authentication

### Required Action
You need to generate an **App Password** for this Office 365 account:

#### For Office 365 Business Accounts:
1. Go to https://portal.office.com
2. Click your profile picture → "My account" 
3. Go to "Security" → "Sign-in security"
4. Select "App passwords"
5. Generate a new app password for "Mail" or "SMTP"
6. Update the SMTP_PASSWORD secret with this new app password

#### For Personal Microsoft Accounts:
1. Go to https://account.microsoft.com/security
2. Click "Advanced security options"
3. Under "App passwords", click "Create a new app password"
4. Select "Mail" as the app type
5. Copy the generated password and update SMTP_PASSWORD

### Testing Process
Once you update the SMTP_PASSWORD secret:

1. **Restart the application** to pick up the new password
2. **Test the connection**: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health`
3. **Send test email**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test-email -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"to": "your-email@example.com"}'`

### Alternative Solutions
If App Passwords don't work, consider:

1. **Use a different SMTP provider** (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
2. **Enable "Less secure app access"** (not recommended for production)
3. **Use OAuth 2.0 authentication** (more complex setup)

### Status: Waiting for App Password
The system is ready - just needs the correct authentication credentials.
