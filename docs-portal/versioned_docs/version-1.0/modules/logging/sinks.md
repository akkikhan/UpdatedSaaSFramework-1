# Log Sinks

The logging service supports multiple outputs:

- **Database** – default PostgreSQL storage for querying in the admin portal.
- **Webhook** – send events to a custom HTTP endpoint.
- **Third‑party providers** – forward logs to Datadog, Splunk, or any provider that accepts HTTP
  intake.

Configure sinks in the admin portal under *Logging > Sinks*.
