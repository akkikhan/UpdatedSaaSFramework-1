Welcome to the official documentation for the SaaS Framework. These pages walk you through
everything needed to integrate the platform into your own applications. Each module includes
prerequisites, step-by-step setup instructions, sample code, and troubleshooting tips so you can
ship features quickly.

Use the sidebar to explore topics or jump straight to the [SDK integration guide](sdk-integration/overview.md)
if you are ready to start building.
