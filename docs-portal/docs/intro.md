# SaaS Platform Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the SaaS Framework. These pages walk you through
everything needed to integrate the platform into your own applications. Each module includes
prerequisites, step-by-step setup instructions, sample code, and troubleshooting tips so you can
ship features quickly.

Use the sidebar to explore topics or jump straight to the [SDK integration guide](sdk-integration/overview.md)
if you are ready to start building.
