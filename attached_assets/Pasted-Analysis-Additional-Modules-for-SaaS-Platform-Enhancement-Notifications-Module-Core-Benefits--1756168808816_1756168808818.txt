ðŸš€ Recommended Implementation Priority
Logging Module (High Priority) - Essential for security, compliance, and troubleshooting
Notifications Module (Medium Priority) - Critical for user engagement and operational alerts
AI Copilot Module (Low Priority) - Advanced feature that enhances user experience but not core functionality
Each module would integrate seamlessly with the existing real-time module management system, allowing platform admins to enable/disable features per tenant with immediate effect.
